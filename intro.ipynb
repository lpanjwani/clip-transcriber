Your boss must be well connected. I've never seen so much for all the doors so quickly. I'm quite so stylishly. May I ask you where it is? Ten million was wired to your accountant, London Agra,\n",

I suppose you've given some thought to the notion that if you lose, our government will have directly financed terrorism. What looks good? So you're telling me it's a matter of probability and it was worried there wasn't chance involved. Well, maybe you're seeing the play with the best hand wins. So that will be what you call bluffing.\n",

Which is why I've been up to detect an undercurrent of sarcasm in your voice. You're no sure, darling. You're not sure, darling. You know what I mean? You're a very good plan to you. So there is a plan. I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars in hundreds of lives on a game of luck. What else can you surprise Mr. Bond? About you, Miss Lin. Well, your beauties are problem. You worry you won't be taken seriously. Which one can say of any attractive woman with heart of brain? True, but this all over the compensates by wearing slightly masculine clothing. closing, being more aggressive than having male colleagues. This gives her a somewhat prickly demeanor. And ironically enough, makes it less likely for her to be accepted and promoted by her male superiors in the Stank Aaron's Accurities for arrogance. Now I didn't normally go on with only child, but you see, by the way, you ignored the quiver like your parents. I'm gonna have to get with the orphan. All right. Why the cut of his suit you went to Oxford or whatever? And actually, think human beings dressed like that. But you were it was such a stain. My guess is you didn't come from money. And your school friends never let you forget it. Which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity. Hence the chip on your shoulder.\n",

Since my six looks from my adjusted young men, I give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect Queen and Country. You know, former SAES types with easy smiles and expensive watches. Rolex. Amiga. Beautiful.\n",

So as charming as you are, Mr. Bond, I will be keeping my eye on our government's money and offer you perfectly full-end hours. You're not just... Even accountants have imagination.
